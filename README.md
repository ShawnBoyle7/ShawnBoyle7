## Hello! I'm Shawn.

I'm a Software Engineer. I have a deep desire to understand what makes something work. My curiosity seems to be an endless well, and I'm always trying to fill it. I feel great passion for developing software because every roadblock I run into feels like I found another piece to a puzzle. Development is a way for me to explore myself and realize my ideas into the world.
